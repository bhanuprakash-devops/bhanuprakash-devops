## About me
I’m a results-driven Senior DevOps Engineer with **6 years** of hands-on experience building and operating cloud-native platforms. I design and ship secure, scalable infrastructure, automate CI/CD at scale, and build observability and platform tooling that helps product teams ship faster and safer.

I focus on production reliability, cost optimization, and developer productivity — and I love turning manual toil into repeatable automation.

---

## Key highlights
- **6 years** experience: DevOps, Cloud, Kubernetes, CI/CD, IaC  
- Built and managed **EKS clusters & AWS infra** for 50+ microservices  
- Implemented CI/CD pipelines that improved release frequency by **3×**  
- Achieved **₹18–23 lakh** annual AWS cost savings via rightsizing & spot instances  
- Reduced deployment failures by **65%** and MTTR by **45%** through automation & observability

## Tech stack (summary)
**Cloud / Infra:** AWS (EC2, VPC, S3, RDS, ECS, EKS, Lambda)  
**Containers & Orchestration:** Docker, Kubernetes (EKS), Helm, Kustomize  
**CI / CD:** Jenkins, GitHub Actions, ArgoCD, Helm releases  
**IaC:** Terraform, CloudFormation  
**Monitoring:** Prometheus, Grafana, ELK, CloudWatch  
**Build / Repository:** Maven, Gradle, Nexus, GHCR, ECR  
**Scripting / Tools:** Bash, Python, Groovy, kubectl, helm, terraform  
**Security / Ops:** IAM, KMS, IRSA, Network Policies, RBAC

## Featured projects
> *Click project names to jump to each repo.*

- **terraform-aws-production-vpc** — Production-grade Terraform modules for VPC, subnets, NAT, route tables and environment separation (dev/staging/prod).  
  *Value:* standardizes network topology across environments; reduces infra provisioning time.

- **eks-cluster-terraform** — EKS provisioning with managed node groups, IRSA patterns and multi-AZ configuration.  
  *Value:* repeatable, secure cluster provisioning for microservices.

- **kubernetes-microservices-demo** — Helm charts & manifests for a sample microservices architecture (templating, resources, autoscaling).  
  *Value:* fast onboarding template for new services.

- **jenkins-ci-cd-example** — Declarative Jenkins pipeline with parallel tests, SonarQube quality gates, Docker build/push and Helm deploy steps.  
  *Value:* production-ready pipeline blueprint for monolith → microservice migrations.

- **github-actions-k8s-pipeline** — GitHub Actions workflow that builds, pushes and deploys to Kubernetes clusters (GHCR/ECR integration).  
  *Value:* modern GitOps-friendly CI/CD patterns.

- **k8s-monitoring-stack** — Prometheus + Grafana + Alertmanager quickstart and example dashboards.  
  *Value:* reduces MTTR and provides service-level observability.

## How I work
- **Infrastructure as Code**: modular Terraform with environment isolation and reusable modules.  
- **GitOps & CI/CD**: pipeline-as-code, declarative release management, and automated validations.  
- **Observability**: metrics-first approach (SLOs, alerts, dashboards).  
- **Security-aware**: least-privilege IAM, Secrets Manager/SSM, IRSA for service accounts.  
- **Cost-conscious**: rightsizing, spot instances, storage lifecycle policies.

## Quickstart / demo
Each repo contains a README with a local dev quickstart, Terraform usage notes, and instructions to deploy sample apps. Start with:
1. `terraform-aws-production-vpc/environments/dev` → `terraform init/plan/apply` (replace placeholders)  
2. `eks-cluster-terraform/terraform/cluster` → provision EKS (requires VPC/subnet IDs)  
3. `kubernetes-microservices-demo/helm/service-a` → `helm install` for sample services

> NOTE: repos contain placeholder values and examples. Do not run in a production account without review.

## How to reach me
- Email: mnbhanu5@gmail.com  
- LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/abc  
- Or open an issue in any repo for technical questions / feedback — I read them all.

## Quick tips for recruiters
If you’re evaluating platform candidates, I can supply:
- A 10–15 minute technical walkthrough (recorded or live) of any repo  
- Evidence pack for Global Talent / visa applications (metrics, architecture, references)  
- Reference contacts and manager recommendation templates

*If you want, I’ll now:*  
1. add SVG badges (build / last commit / license / languages) for each repo,  
2. create PNG architecture diagrams and embed them into READMEs, and  
3. prepare a GitHub profile README image banner.  

Say **“Chaya, add badges and diagrams”** when you’re ready.
